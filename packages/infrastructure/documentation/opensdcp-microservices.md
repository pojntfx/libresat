# OpenSDCP Node/Go Microservices

> Let's make OpenSDCP the OpenStack of satellite development!
> Also, make up some nice code names (greek mythology?)
> Visualize as service mesh

* Identity
* Infrastructure dashboard (OpenStack + Kubernetes)
* Service Discovery
* Git (Frontend and "Editorial Workflow")
* Dashboard UI
* Text
* Video
* Docs (JSON blocks created by Jekyll)
* Dashboard layouts (redis)
* Soundmodem
* Rotator
* Locator (SatNOGS)
* ...communityServices (openscdp-forum, wiki, git etc.)
* Comments
* LTSP (ground station)
* Connection
* (Push) notifications
* Block storage
* Object storage
* Networking
* Hosts
* Centralized API endpoint (dynamic schema from service discovery)
* Atomic Host 
* Atomic Client

> Remove hierarchy (expose OpenStack services)
> Isochronic Architecture: OpenSNET Node, Bridge and Client run the same architecture & stack
> Difference: OSTree Repo/Flatpaks
> Updates: git pull inside the OSTree
