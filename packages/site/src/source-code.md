{% include global/segment-top.html title="Philosophy" %}

Everything we create and maintain (both the hardware and the software)
is open-source and free as in freedom. This means that by using our software
all the four essential freedoms of free software as defined by [
Richard Stallman](https://stallman.org/) are given to you, so you have the ...

1.  Freedom to run the program as you wish.
2.  Freedom to study the source code of the program and then change it so the program does what you wish.
3.  Freedom to help your neighbour. That’s the freedom to redistribute the exact copies of the software when you wish.
4.  Freedom to contribute to your community. That’s the freedom to distribute copies or modified versions when you wish.

While we work primarly with GitHub for issue tracking and in order to
reach a greater audience, we also have a public, self hosted Gitea (will
be implemented soon) instance. Gitea is an open-source alternative to
GitHub used by organisations such as the Free Sofware Foundation Europe
(FSFE). We recommend exploring the repositories through it and opening
up issues there, but you may of course also use GitHub as both repos are
being kept in sync.

With that in mind, visit either our open-source work-in-progress [Gitea instance](https://git.openscdp.org)
or [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/opensdcp) to look
at the source code by either clicking on the links above or the cards below.

{% include global/segment-top.html title="Code of Conduct" %}
We use a nearly 1:1 copy of the
[GNOME code of conduct](https://live.gnome.org/CodeOfConduct)
as we find it to be simple, helpful and concise.

## Summary

The OpenSDCP project creates software and hardware for a better world. We
achieve this by behaving well towards each other. Therefore this document
suggests what we consider ideal behaviour, so you know what to expect when
getting involved in the OpenSDCP project. This is who we are and what we
want to be. There is no official enforcement of these principles, and this
should not be interpreted like a legal document.

## Advice

<dl>
<dt>Be respectful and considerate:</dt>
<dd>
Disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour or personal attacks.
Remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable is not a
productive one.
</dd>
<dt>Be patient and generous:</dt>
<dd>
If someone asks for help it is because they need it. Do politely
suggest specific documentation or more appropriate venues where
appropriate, but avoid aggressive or vague responses such as "RTFM".
</dd>
<dt>Assume people mean well:</dt>
<dd>
Remember that decisions are often a difficult choice between competing
priorities. If you disagree, please do so politely. If something seems
outrageous, check that you did not misinterpret it. Ask for
clarification, but do not assume the worst. Try to be concise: Avoid
repeating what has been said already. Making a conversation larger
makes it difficult to follow, and people often feel personally
attacked if they receive multiple messages telling them the same
thing.
