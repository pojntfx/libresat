# We Have a New Website!

This is awesome, it is now possible to use [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) inside of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) thanks to the revolutionary [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

Using MDX over standard Markdown has many advantages, specifically when it comes to `gatsby-mdx`'s flexibility. You can replace the standard markdown components with custom ones! For example, in Gatsby, it is possible to link to a local page with client-site routing (which allows for smoother offline usage and a "native" feel). For example, [this link to the home page](/) uses Gatsby's client-side routing, while [this external link to DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) does not.
