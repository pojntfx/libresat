# OpenSDCP Swarm Manager

Portainer service configuration for the OpenSDCP project.

> Consider reading the [infrastructure overview](https://github.com/opensdcp/opensdcp-infrastructure#overview) before continuing.

## Demo

Visit [cpanel.opensdcp.org](https://cpanel.opensdcp.org/) and take a look at our instance (you can not login however, obviously).

## Usage

### Preparation

```bash
# Install dependencies (Ubuntu and Debian)
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
```

### Startup

```bash
# Serve development version on http://YOUR_IP:1100
docker-compose -f opensdcp-swarm-manager-dev.yml up
# ALTERNATIVE: Serve production version on http://YOUR_IP:1000
docker-compose -f opensdcp-swarm-manager-prod.yml up
```

### Setup

Visit `http://YOUR_IP:YOUR_PORT_FROM_ABOVE` and create the admin user. In case a login field appears but you've not yet set up an account, clear the browser's cache and reload. Select the "Local" environment and try it out!

> If you chose the development version, all the data will be saved in `./opensdcp-swarm-manager-web-data-dev/` in case you want to create backups. If you used the production version, it will be saved in the `opensdcp-swarm-manager-web-data` docker volume.
